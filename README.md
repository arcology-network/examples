Arcology provides several concurrent examples to help you get started. These examples demonstrate the basics of building concurrent applications on the Arcology Network using Arcologyâ€™s concurrent library.


<h2> Prerequisites  <img align="center" height="25" src="./img/ruler.svg">  </h2>
You need the following tools installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- Yarn
- A Arcology DevNet docker container

<h2> Get the DevNet <img align="center" height="25" src="./img/cloud.svg">  </h2>

```shell
 ip=192.168.1.109;docker run -itd --name l1 -p 8545:8545 -p 26656:26656 -p 9191:9191 -p 9192:9192 -p 9292:9292 arcologynetwork/devnet -f http://$ip:7545 -b http://$ip:3500 -s http://$ip:8545 -r true -m false
```
>> Replace the `ip` variable with your machine's local IP address.

You should see an output similar to this:

### Package Stucture:

- **Scaffold:** Starting point with for building concurrent applications.

- **Account:** Accounts for testing purpose.
  
- [**eth-examples:**](./eth-examples/README.md) Parallelized examples derived from some of the [original Ethereum examples](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/solidity-by-example.html). 

- [**ds-token:**](./ds-token/README.md) A parallelized version of the [original ds-token project](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-token).
  
<h2> Running Scaffold Examples <img align="center" height="25" src="./img/running.svg">  </h2>

### Update the Network Configuration


Under the `scaffold` directory, execute the following command to install the dependencies:

```shell
   scaffold> yarn
```

### 1. Run the Parallel Like

A contract and keeps track of the number of calls made to it concurrently.
```shell 
   scaffold> yarn hardhat run test/test-like.js --network TestnetInfo
```

Benchmarking the example:

```shell
   scaffold> yarn hardhat run test/benchmark-like.js --network TestnetInfo
```



### 2. Run the Subcurrency

An Ethereum example.
```shell
   scaffold> yarn hardhat run test/test-subCurrency.js --network TestnetInfo
```

Benchmarking the example:

```shell
   scaffold> yarn hardhat run test/benchmark-subCurrency.js --network TestnetInfo
```

## Benchmarking

The `benchmark` folder contains performance test scripts, each in its own subfolder. For example, run the transaction generation script for the `Like` case can be found in the `like` subdirectory:

```shell
scaffold> benchmark/like/gen-tx-like.js
```

### Generating Transactions
Run the following command to generate transactions for the `Like` example:

```shell
   scaffold> yarn hardhat run benchmark/like/gen-tx-like.js --network TestnetInfo
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```shell
shell ===========start create like===================== Deployed Like Test at 0xBe5a9f4b7C2AF3000bAc55e114Ec3A3d55d330db ===========start generate like tx===================== Generating Tx data [**** ] 9% 131.4s
```

The generated transaction files can be found in the `txs` subdirectory. 

```shell
   scaffold> benchmark/like/txs/like/like.out
```

### Install the TPS Monitoring Tool
Install a light TPS monitor:

```shell
   scaffold> npm install -g @arcologynetwork/frontend-tools
```

### Sending the Transactions

Then run the benchmarking scripts to send the transactions and measure performance.

```shell
   scaffold> yarn hardhat run benchmark/like/bench-tx-like.js --network TestnetInfo
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```shell
