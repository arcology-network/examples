## simple

The `simple` directory contains examples showcasing some simple example to support concurrent programming with Arcology's concurrent library. Explore this section to understand the basics of concurrent programming and how to implement it using Arcology's features.

## ds-token

The `ds-token` directory hosts a parallelized version of the [original ds-token project](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-token). Learn how parallelization techniques have been applied to enhance the performance of ds-token.

## eth-examples

In the `eth-examples` directory, you'll find parallelized examples derived from some of the [original Ethereum examples](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/solidity-by-example.html). 

## parallel-kitties

The `parallel-kitties` directory focuses on parallelizing the [original CryptoKitties project](https://github.com/dapperlabs/cryptokitties-bounty). Explore this section to gain insights into optimizing and parallelizing blockchain-based applications.
